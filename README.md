###My solutions to Project Euler problems [https://projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net)

You can run all solutions by running

       ruby all_solutions.rb

Each solution is packaged in its own file named Problem[#].rb in the following format:

       # [problem number]: [problem summary] ([answer])
       def problem[problem number]
           ...code...
           # return answer
       end
       
There is some ugly code in here, please be gentle :)
